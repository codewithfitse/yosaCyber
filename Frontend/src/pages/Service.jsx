              When companies throughout the United States require
              temperature-controlled shipping, nothing beats a refrigerated
              truck. Often referred to as reefer trucks, these vehicles are
              equipped with the necessary technology to maintain the freshness
              of meat, produce, and other delicate cargo in optimal atmospheric
              conditions. At Dawit Freighters we have extensive knowledge in
              navigating this so you can focus on what you do best
